### Statistics Review (Limited) and Probabilistic Model (Distribution) in ML

#### Distribution Concepts

- _"The *shape* of data"_
- Of course _not *all* data can be considered_ in evaluating statistics on any one subject. So instead we'll look at _samples_ of data, and in doing so will look for _shapes_ in the data.

#### Probabilistic Model

- There exists a probability distribution $D$ over input/output pairs
- If we write $x$ as input and $y$ as output, then $D$ is a distribution over $(x,y)$ pairs.
- This is often called the _data generating distribution_

- Unreasonable pairs occur rarely while more reasonable input-output pairs occur more often.
