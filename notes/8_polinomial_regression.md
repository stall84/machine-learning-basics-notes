- A polinomial linear regression is a version of the [_multiple linear regression_.](./7-multiple-linear-regression.md)
- Being able to raise the variables to a power can sometimes better model your data than a simple or multiple linear regression can.
- Since your unknown elements of any of the machine-learning regression models are the _coefficients_ (and not the $X$ variables/predictors), this is still a type of _linear_ regression.
